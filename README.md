### Overview
This was my final project for my Natural Language Processing course. I used labled twitter data that was catagorizing by the subject and as a positive neutral or negitive tweets. This was used to train a naive bayes classifier and identify common words associated with negitive or positive sentiments.

### Data Sources
The dataset I reference for this project is from Kaggle and is a collection of tweets it was compiled in the year 2022. The data contains 12447 unique entried and has four features:
- ID
- Catagory/Game
- Sentiment
- Tweet

### Tools
- Excel: initial exploration, manual cleaning, calculate and store new data.
- Python: (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, NLTK, Sklearn) â€“ data wrangling, data cleaning, data visualization, and model building.

### Data Cleaning
In the initial data cleaning process I used python to removed all rows with null entries. I then nomalized all comlumns so all strings were lowercase as well as removing punctuation, links and @'s in the tweets column. This greatly reduced the number of token that would need be analysed will preserving the integrity of the data.

### Exploratiry Data Analysis
EDA Reviled that the data held:
1. There are 32 unique catagories in the data.

2. Each catagory contains roughly 400 tweets pretaining to it.

3. Created an ordered list of of the catagories based on the distribution of positive and negative tweets.

4. Establish the most frequent words to appear in positive tweets.

### Data Analysis
To train my naive bayes classifier I split the data into 80% for training and 20% for testing. \
